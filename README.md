# COSE242-24.2

### Topic
Building a **Local Live Streaming** System Using **Raspberry Pi**


### Process
1. Capture **video** from a camera connected to the Raspberry Pi
2. Process the video feed in real-time
3. Stream it over a **local network**


### Objective
To build a local live streaming system using the Raspberry Pi as a cost-effective platform for video capture and streaming.
To utilize the V4L2C packages to interact with video devices, enabling real-time video capture and processing.
To implement a streaming server on the Raspberry Pi that distributes the live video feed to devices connected to the same local network.
To ensure the system operates with minimal latency and maintains a stable video quality suitable for real-time applications.


### Technical Approach
The project will be divided into the following phases:

##### 3.1. System Setup
Hardware Setup: Configure the Raspberry Pi board, camera module, and network connectivity.

Software Installation: Install the Raspberry Pi OS, necessary libraries, and packages, including V4L2C, FFmpeg, and VLC.
Network Configuration: Set up the Raspberry Pi to function within the local network and assign a static IP address for stable communication.

##### 3.2. Video Capture and Processing
V4L2C Configuration: Configure V4L2C to interact with the camera module for video capture. This will involve setting the appropriate resolution, frame rate, and video encoding options.
Real-Time Processing: Use FFmpeg or GStreamer to encode the captured video stream and prepare it for transmission.

##### 3.3. Streaming Server Implementation
Streaming Protocol Selection: Choose a suitable protocol (e.g., UDP) for streaming the video feed over the local network.
Server Configuration: Set up a lightweight streaming server on the Raspberry Pi, such as VLC or a custom Python-based server using GStreamer.

##### 3.4. Client Access and Playback
Client Devices: Test video streaming on various client devices (e.g., laptops) connected to the same local network.
Analyze Data & Application : With obtained streaming video, analyze the packet and implement a object tracker using YOLO.


### Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, the following outcomes are anticipated:
A fully functional local live streaming system that can broadcast video captured by the Raspberry Pi camera over a local network.
Documentation on the system configuration, including steps for setting up V4L2C and streaming services.
Performance analysis report detailing the systemâ€™s latency, video quality, and network bandwidth usage.


### Conclusion
This project will demonstrate a practical application of data communication principles through the design of a local live streaming system using Raspberry Pi. It will provide a cost-effective and accessible solution for real-time video streaming, with potential use cases in surveillance, live events, and remote monitoring.
The proposed system not only showcases the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi in handling video communication tasks but also explores the use of V4L2C for efficient video device control. The outcome will contribute to practical knowledge in building streaming solutions and understanding the challenges of low-latency video transmission in local network.
